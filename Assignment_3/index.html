  <h3>TRIBES OF ADILABAD</h3>
  <br>
  <p class="para"><br>
    The tribes of India constitute 8.2% of the total population. Our country has the largest number of tribes as compared to any other country. There are a variety of groups of tribes..Tribes of  Adilabad hidden behind the infamous backwardness of Adilabad is a treasure trove of tribal culture waiting to be explored. The district has enormous potential for culture tourism thanks to its nearly 3.5 lakh Adivasi population, the dominant being the Gonds and Kolams, who continue to latch on to its glorious traditions.
    Tribal people are a grossly misunderstood segment of society as they are considered superstitious and their poverty is often confused with lacking in culture. In reality, the way of life of the Adivasis is one of absolute consonance with nature and it is this aspect that can be seen in tribal villages in this district.

      <h5>PRESENT STATUS</h5>
      <p>From marks of status to a kind of jewellery, tattoos are part of a centuries-old Indian tradition. As the country's urban youth takes to body art, youngsters from tribal communities are abandoning it because it reveals their origins and could lead to discrimination.
Over the past decade, tattoos have become a fashion statement among urban Indian youth, but body art has been practiced for centuriesu/ in many Indian communities. Known as godna, a term widely used among tribals in central and eastern India, it serves different purposes in different communities, as a journey to villages in Jharkhand and Bihar revealed.

  <p class="para"><br>
    The Adivasi women were tattoo lovers centuries before the modern world found something fashionable in it. They use all herbal materials for their tattooing. The methods they use for tattooing are very eco-friendly and therapeutic (safe method - handpoking). They make the kajal which is used to first draw the design , from erandi ka tel (caster oil) which a completely natural product. Then after they make the design on the skin , they make the permanent tattoo by handpoking using a needle which is completely sanitized and hygienic. They use one needle to do 3 TATTOOS. After that needle is used they throw it away. It might take hours to finish one design. That is how it's all done.
